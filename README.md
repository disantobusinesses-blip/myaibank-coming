# MyAiBank Coming Soon

A dark purple, glassmorphic coming-soon experience for the MyAiBank launch. The page is built with React and Vite so we can layer on interactive features like the live countdown, newsletter opt-in, and Vercel Speed Insights.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at the URL Vite prints in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized assets will be written to the `dist/` directory. Preview the build with:

```bash
npm run preview
```
